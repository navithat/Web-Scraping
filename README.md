WEB SCRAPING


Web scraping, the process of extracting data from websites, is widely used for collecting information. While it can be done manually, it's typically automated using software tools called web scrapers or web crawling bots. Web scraping requires access to tools such as Alteryx or programming languages such as Python or R. However, let's explore how to import tabular data from web pages using only Excel or Google Sheets.

Here are some common uses of web scraping:

Overall, web scraping is a powerful tool for extracting valuable data from the vast amount of information available on the internet, enabling businesses, researchers, and individuals to make informed decisions and gain insights into various aspects of their fields of interest.
